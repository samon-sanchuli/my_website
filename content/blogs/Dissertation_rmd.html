<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This paper investigates the relationship between inequality, credit markets and human capital accumulation. The theory suggests that inequality negatively impacts educational attainment through imperfect credit markets. Based on a panel analysis of 217 countries for the years 1965-2019, this study finds evidence in support of this theory. The study uses the income share of the poorest 20% of the population to measure economic inequality; tertiary education enrolment rates to determine human capital accumulation; and the number of days required to enforce a commercial contract as an indicator of credit market efficiency. The data shows that inefficient credit markets strengthen the negative relationship between inequality and education. This means that the inability to borrow hinders education. Another, slightly less robust finding suggests that in the presence of near-perfect credit markets, inequality has a positive effect on schooling attainment.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On a macro-level, imperfect credit markets are seen as one of the key drivers behind the negative relationship between inequality and the national education level (Deininger and Squire 1998). Inspired by a wave of endogenous growth theories, Galor and Zeira (1993) construct a model where initial wealth distribution determines the rate of human capital accumulation through inefficiencies in credit markets. In this model, binding credit constraints force poor individuals to underinvest in education. Galor and Zeira are just one example out of many theoretical contributions which make a similar argument (Banerjee and Newman 1993, Piketty 1997a, see Ehrhart 2009 and Piketty 2000 for a review). Unequal access to credit has solidly entered economic textbooks as the key factor which explains differences in schooling attainment (Ray 1998, Weil 2012).</p>
<p>Similarly, on a micro-level, the inability to borrow is viewed as an important determinant for individual schooling choices. Most of the theoretical work in this direction is grounded in the life-cycle framework (Ando and Modigliani 1963). Deaton and Muellbauer’s (1980) criticism encouraged researches to incorporate credit constraints into the life-cycle models. These models add considerable sophistication to the relationship between borrowing constraints and educational decisions. They account for the effects of differences in individual ability, work-leisure preferences and various assumptions regarding consumption choices (Cameron and Taber 2004, Lochner and Monge-Naranjo 2012).</p>
<p>Both micro- and macro-empirical literature provide suggestive evidence in favour of credit market imperfection theory. For example, micro-empirical researchers suspect borrowing constraints to drive the well-documented positive association between parental income and individual schooling choices (Cameron and Heckman 2001, Black and Devereux 2011). On a macro-level, credit market imperfections are blamed for the negative relationship between inequality and average educational attainment among poor people (Cingano 2014). However, in both cases, there exist plausible alternative explanations which cannot be rejected without directly measuring the efficiency of the credit market. Furthermore, except for Perotti’s (1994), no other study emphasises the interaction between inequality and borrowing constraints. This paper is an attempt to correct these shortcomings.</p>
<p>This study explicitly takes a macro-economic perspective. The central question it asks is: Does the presence of greater credit market inefficiencies exacerbate the negative relationship between inequality and human capital accumulation?
To find an appropriate measure for credit market imperfections, I survey previous attempts from different branches of literature (McKinnon 1973, King and Levine 1993a, Levine 1999, Jappelli et al. 2006) and identify the ‘enforcement quality’ approach as particularly suitable for the main question of this paper. The idea behind it is that if fleeing loan repayment is costly, fewer people are going to shirk, which encourages lending. Surprisingly, studies that apply this approach to education are virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>This paper uses panel data on 217 countries over a span of 55 years. As a proxy for enforcement quality, it uses data on the number of days required to enforce a commercial contract. The income share of the poorest 20% of the population and the university enrolment rates are used to approximate inequality and human capital accumulation, respectively.
This study finds that inefficient credit markets strengthen the negative relationship between economic inequality and average schooling attainment. So, the inability to borrow does seem to hinder education. This finding is robust to most changes in the statistical specification. Furthermore, the results also suggest, albeit not very robustly, that in the presence of nearly perfect credit markets, the relationship between inequality and education becomes positive. One potential reason behind this is that income differentials motivate individuals to strive towards greater rates of return. In other words, inequality of outcome combined with equality of opportunity incentivises people to invest in human capital. This means that inequality impacts education through two distinct mechanisms - the first drives the negative association, whereas the second drives a positive one. The efficiency of credit markets determines which mechanism prevails.</p>

<div id="methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>This paper aims to understand how inequality, combined with credit market imperfections, affects human capital accumulation. Following the Galor and Zeira (1993) model, I propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<p>H1: Inefficient credit markets strengthen the negative relationship between inequality and human capital accumulation;</p>
<p>H2: In the presence of similar degrees of credit market imperfections, inequality has a negative effect on human capital accumulation;</p>
<p>H3: Given a similar level of inequality, the degree of credit market imperfection has a negative impact on the rate of human capital accumulation.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, I adopt an interaction-term-based statistical specification similar to the one proposed by Perotti (1994). The key difference is that this paper uses a country-fixed effects regression model. Such research design helps to control for unobserved country-level differences, which may affect the independent variable. This helps to minimise the possibility of omitted variable bias in the results. The exact model specification is the following:</p>

<p>where</p>
<p>𝑖 indicates a country,</p>
<p>𝑡 represents a year</p>
<p>𝛼 is a country-dependent constant.</p>
<p>HUMCAP, INEQ and IMP stand for human capital investments, level of inequality and degree of credit market imperfections, respectively. Most importantly, 𝛽&amp; represents the coefficient of the interaction term between inequality and credit market imperfections.
The term 𝛽 + 𝛽 𝐼𝑀𝑃 represents the effect that inequality has on educational # &amp; !”
attainment conditional on variations in credit market imperfections. Similarly, 𝛽% +</p>
<p>𝛽&amp; 𝐼𝑁𝐸𝑄!” stands for the effect of imperfect credit market on human capital accumulation with the given level of inequality. Therefore, in accordance with H1, one would expect 𝛽&amp; &lt; 0. If this is the case, an increase in the degree of credit market imperfections will strengthen the negative effect that inequality has on human capital accumulation, as predicted by the Galor and Zeira model. Furthermore, based on the hypotheses H2 and H3, it is reasonable to expect that 𝛽# &lt; 0 and 𝛽% &lt; 0. Finally, it needs to be noted that the three hypotheses stated above are not co-dependent. That is, it can very well be the case that H2 and H3 are false when H1 is true.</p>
<div id="variables-and-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Variables and Data</h2>
<p>The analysis is based on a panel dataset made up of observations of 217 countries between the years 1965 to 2019. As mentioned earlier, the main indicator for the degree of credit market imperfections is the ‘time required to enforce a contract’ taken from the World Bank. The ‘financial depth’ and ‘financial development’ approaches are represented by the ‘domestic-credit-to-private-sector-to-GDP-ratio’ and the spread between lending and borrowing interest rates, respectively. These are sourced from the same database.</p>
<p>World Bank estimates for the income share of the poorest 20% of the population are used to indicate income dispersion. It is important to note that nominally income share is a measure of equality, which is the opposite of inequality. In other words, numerical increases in this variable represent a lower level of inequality. Therefore, when using this indicator, the coefficient for the interaction term is expected to have a positive sign. This indicator has an advantage over the standard Gini coefficient because it directly targets the people who are most likely to require assistance from efficient credit markets to obtain an education. Furthermore, Voitchovsky (2005), in her influential study, finds that the profile of income inequality matters for economic growth. More specifically, she found that greater inequality at the bottom of the income distribution has a greater adverse effect on economic performance, while the opposite is true for the inequality at the top. This further justifies targeting the bottom of the income distribution.</p>
<p>To measure the rates of human capital accumulation, this study uses data on the percentage of people within the relevant age group who are enrolled in tertiary education (UNESCO 2019). Since most of the countries provide free and compulsory secondary education, it is reasonable to suggest that capital market imperfections are going to mostly affect higher education attainment. Furthermore, theoretically, credit constraints coupled with indivisibility of the investment in education would have immediate effect on the individual’s ability to enrol. For these reasons, the yearly enrolment rate is a more precise indicator than the traditionally used ‘mean years of schooling’ from Barro and Lee (2013). Nevertheless, I use the latter for a robustness check.</p>
