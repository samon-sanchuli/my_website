description: This paper investigates the relationship between inequality, credit markets and human capital accumulation. The theory suggests that inequality negatively impacts educational attainment through imperfect credit markets. Based on a panel analysis of 217 countries for the years 1965-2019, this study finds evidence in support of this theory.
