description: This paper investigates the relationship between inequality, credit markets and human capital accumulation. The theory suggests that inequality negatively impacts educational attainment through imperfect credit markets. Based on a panel analysis of 217 countries for the years 1965-2019, this study finds evidence in support of this theory.

# Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?
>The dataset in 2020 has a smaller kurtosis compared to previous years. The kurtosis reveals a distribution with flat tails. The flat tails indicate the small outliers in a distribution. In this case, the numbers of bike hires per month experienced less extreme cases, and the numbers are less than that compared to previous years. This can be explained by the qurantine policies introduced during Covid periods. 

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
tfl_absolute_monthly_change1 <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  mutate(expected = median(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise(expected = median(expected), 
            actual = median(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  mutate(excess = actual - expected)
```  

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change1, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(tfl_absolute_monthly_change1, aes(x=month, group=1))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(actual < expected, actual, expected), ymax = expected),fill= "green", alpha=0.1)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected, ymax=ifelse(actual > expected, actual, expected)),fill="red", alpha=0.1)+
    geom_line(aes(y=expected), color= "blue", size=0.5)+
    geom_line(aes(y=actual))+
    facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme_bw()
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
tfl_percent_change1 <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  mutate(weekly_average = median(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(weekly_average = mean(weekly_average), 
            actual_hired = median(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_change = actual_hired / weekly_average - 1)
```

```{r tfl_percent_change1, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(tfl_percent_change1, aes(x=week, group=1))+
  geom_rect(xmin=13,xmax=26, ymin=-0.6, ymax=0.6, colour="grey", alpha=0.003)+
  geom_rect(xmin=39,xmax=52, ymin=-0.6, ymax=0.6, colour="grey", alpha=0.003)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,
                  ymax=ifelse(percentage_change>0,percentage_change ,0)), 
              fill="green" ,alpha=0.15)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=ifelse(percentage_change<0, percentage_change,0), 
                  ymax=0), 
              fill="red", alpha=0.15)+
  geom_line(aes(y=percentage_change))+
  geom_rug(side="week", 
           aes(color=ifelse(percentage_change<0,"red", "green")))+
  guides(color=FALSE)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(13,26,39,52))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme_bw()

```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Challenge 2: How has the CPI and its components changed over the last few years?

Remember how we used the tidyqant package to download CPI data. In this exercise, I would like you to do the following:

1. You can find [CPI components at  FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843). You should adapt the code from German polls to scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector. FIY, the list of components is the second table in that webpage.

```{r}
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"

# get tables that exist on the FRED website
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
CPI_data <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())
```

```{r}
CPI_series <- CPI_data[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the list of all CPI components
  select(series_id)

CPI_series_vector<- as.vector(t(CPI_series)) #pull CPI components into a vector
  
CPI <- tidyquant::tq_get(CPI_series_vector, get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")

CPI <- left_join(CPI, CPI_data[[2]],
                     by = c("symbol" = "series_id"))
```

```{r}
CPI <- CPI %>%
  group_by(title) %>% 
  mutate(year_change = price/lag(price, 12, na.rm = TRUE) - 1, date)
            
CPI <- CPI %>%         
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: ")) %>% 
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, " in U.S. City Average")) %>% #remove redundant title
  group_by(date) %>%
  arrange(date, desc(year_change))
```

  
```{r out.width="100%"}
CPI_graph1 <- CPI %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change < 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "grey", na.rm = TRUE) + #colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative
  facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components", 
       subtitle="YoY change being positive or negative \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       x="",
       y="YoY % Change",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

CPI_graph1
```

This graphs is fine, but perhaps has too many sub-categories. You can find the [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm) here. Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?

```{r}
CPI_graph2 <- CPI %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01") %>% 
  filter( title ==c("Housing", "Transportation", "Food and Beverages", "Apparel") ) %>% #only keep major categories
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change < 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "grey", na.rm = TRUE) + #colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative
  facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (major categories)", 
       subtitle="YoY change being positive or negative \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       x="",
       y="YoY % Change",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

CPI_graph2

```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
