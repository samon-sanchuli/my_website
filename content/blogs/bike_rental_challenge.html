<p>#Summary</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project investigates the patterns behind TFL bike rentals. We look at bike rental data from 2016 and observe how it
varies year by year. The most interesting patterns emerge during the pandemic. The data shows that there were &gt;significatnly &gt; less bike hires during the pandemic. It also shows that there are less extreme values in the data &gt;distribution. The last &gt;graphs shows bike rentals againts the same period last year.</p>

<h1>Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing</h1>
<p>Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following</p>

<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<p>Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. Whatâ€™s happening?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dataset in 2020 has a smaller kurtosis compared to previous years. The kurtosis reveals a distribution with flat tails. The flat tails indicate the small outliers in a distribution. In this case, the numbers of bike hires per month experienced less extreme cases, and the numbers are less than that compared to previous years. This can be explained by the qurantine policies introduced during Covid periods.</p>

<p>However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.</p>
<p><img src="/Users/samonsanchuli/Documents/LBS Studies/Data Analytics/my_website/images/tfl_monthly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>tfl_absolute_monthly_change1 &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;=2016) %&gt;% 
  group_by(month) %&gt;% 
  mutate(expected = median(bikes_hired)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup %&gt;% 
  group_by(month, year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(expected = median(expected), 
            actual = median(bikes_hired)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(excess = actual - expected)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(tfl_absolute_monthly_change1, aes(x=month, group=1))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(actual &lt; expected, actual, expected), ymax = expected),fill= &quot;green&quot;, alpha=0.1)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected, ymax=ifelse(actual &gt; expected, actual, expected)),fill=&quot;red&quot;, alpha=0.1)+
    geom_line(aes(y=expected), color= &quot;blue&quot;, size=0.5)+
    geom_line(aes(y=actual))+
    facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/bike_rental_challenge_files/figure-html/tfl_absolute_monthly_change1-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
<p><img src="/Users/samonsanchuli/Documents/LBS Studies/Data Analytics/my_website/images/tfl_weekly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>tfl_percent_change1 &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year&gt;=2016) %&gt;% 
  group_by(week) %&gt;% 
  mutate(weekly_average = median(bikes_hired)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup %&gt;% 
  group_by(week, year) %&gt;% 
  summarise(weekly_average = mean(weekly_average), 
            actual_hired = median(bikes_hired)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(percentage_change = actual_hired / weekly_average - 1)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(tfl_percent_change1, aes(x=week, group=1))+

  geom_rect(xmin=39,xmax=52, ymin=-0.6, ymax=0.6, colour=&quot;grey&quot;, alpha=0.003)+

<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
