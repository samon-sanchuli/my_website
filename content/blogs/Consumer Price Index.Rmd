# Summary

>This project investigates the movements in the Consumer Price Index. The analysis strategy is to break down the CPI into its components and underdtand which parts contribute the most to the observed changes. The final graphs in this project clearly show that increases in the praices for apparel, food and bewarages contribute the most to the the 2021 inflation numebrs.

# Investigating changes in CPI over the past few years

Remember how we used the tidyqant package to download CPI data. In this exercise, I would like you to do the following:

1. You can find [CPI components at  FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843). You should adapt the code from German polls to scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector. FIY, the list of components is the second table in that webpage.

```{r}
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"

# get tables that exist on the FRED website
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
CPI_data <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())
```

```{r}
CPI_series <- CPI_data[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the list of all CPI components
  select(series_id)

CPI_series_vector<- as.vector(t(CPI_series)) #pull CPI components into a vector
  
CPI <- tidyquant::tq_get(CPI_series_vector, get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")

CPI <- left_join(CPI, CPI_data[[2]],
                     by = c("symbol" = "series_id"))
```

```{r}
CPI <- CPI %>%
  group_by(title) %>% 
  mutate(year_change = price/lag(price, 12, na.rm = TRUE) - 1, date)
            
CPI <- CPI %>%         
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: ")) %>% 
  mutate(title = str_remove_all(title, " in U.S. City Average")) %>% #remove redundant title
  group_by(date) %>%
  arrange(date, desc(year_change))
```

  
```{r out.width="100%"}
CPI_graph1 <- CPI %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change < 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "grey", na.rm = TRUE) + #colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative
  facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components", 
       subtitle="YoY change being positive or negative \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       x="",
       y="YoY % Change",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

CPI_graph1
```

This graphs is fine, but perhaps has too many sub-categories. You can find the [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm) here. Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?

```{r}
CPI_graph2 <- CPI %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-01-01") %>% 
  filter( title ==c("Housing", "Transportation", "Food and Beverages", "Apparel") ) %>% #only keep major categories
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = year_change < 0)) +
  geom_smooth(colour = "grey", na.rm = TRUE) + #colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative
  facet_wrap(~title, scales = "free") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (major categories)", 
       subtitle="YoY change being positive or negative \nJan 2016 to Aug 2021",
       x="",
       y="YoY % Change",
       caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED \nhttps://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

CPI_graph2

```
